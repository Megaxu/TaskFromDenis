Simple task from my friend.

Two integer numbers a and b are provided to the app (a < b). Make an application that finds an integer number in the interval from a to b [a, b] with a biggest sum of its dividers.
As a result the application must show two numbers in one line separated by the space character: the first one is a number with a biggest sum of its deviders, the second number us the sum of dividers.
